                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Kyle Young. I am 21 years old, my birthday is July 20<sup>th</sup>, and attend Algonquin College for Interactive Media Design. I took this course knowing I was interested in the field but am not sure of a particular field I would want to pursue quite yet. Going into this course I was a little more interested in the photography and photo/video editing aspect but now starting the course I am very interested in the coding aspect as well.

                    This summer was an amazing time in my life. Though I was in school, I met new friends, got out of the house a lot, and was able to spend quality time with the people I cared about quite often. On top of all that I did this summer, I also got my first tattoo. The tattoo I got was an ONI, which is a Japanese demon, merged into the blade of a katana. The tattoo was one of, if not the most expensive purchase I've made to treat myself, <strong>nearing $1000</strong>. The only way I was able to afford this tattoo is because I started working at Planet Fitness on Merivale <abbr title="Road">Rd</abbr>.
